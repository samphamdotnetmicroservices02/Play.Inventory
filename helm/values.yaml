# this list of environment variables is just an array. So this is how you define an array in a yaml file. Each of the elements start
# with dash, and then it has a name and a value for each of the elements in the array. And we could use this syntax if we wanted to
# extract values from deploying.yaml. However, it is a better practice to instead of using an array, use a dictionary for other each
# of these values, just so that in the future, when you want to override or expand one of the values in this list, you can easily
# do with new values.yaml files or via other methods. So if each microservice want to define something extra, you can expand the list
# in that sense. So that would be challenging with an array, but it is toally doable via a dictionary. So, how do we turn this array
# into a dictionary?
# envVariables:
#   - name: ServiceSettings__MessageBroker
#     value: SERVICEBUS
#   - name: ServiceSettings__KeyVaultName
#     value: samphamplayeconomykv

# Now we turn array into a dictionary
